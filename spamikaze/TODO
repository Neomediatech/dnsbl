	TODO items for spamikaze


For version 0.4:
  * integrate evidence fetching cgi script
  * more scalable table layout for MySQL, similar to PostgreSQL 3 tables
  * IPv6 support (requires new MySQL table schema)

For later versions:
  * integrate query statistics
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks
